Version 0.0.01r

Revised Prototype data structure released.

We have enabled new cluster architecture on top of distributed hosting for redundancy and 100% uptime of the app. 

The tests conducted included real-time catastrophic failures in 17 of 18 different servers around the world.

In test after test, the one remaining server, the weakest of them all, with the worst connectivity and data transfer quality, successfully maintained the entire system, and was able to restore the full network within 0.0941 nanoseconds.

We ran the same test on every other server, each time causing catastrophic failure in all but one machine, and each time, the sole survivor (designed to be more robust by increasing load capability and processing power, as well as memory, as the others drop off), succeeded in replicating the success of the first test, and every single one restored the full network in under 0.1 nanoseconds.

The network itself is comprised of fiber optic cables and satellite transmissions. 3G and wifi are available to mobile end users as well as desktop or laptop users.

So far, so good.
