It's bananas here.

The code is taking forever.

The pizza delivery girl is in shock at the 19 pies and 2 cases of Coke we have ordered in the last 18 hours.  Well, what'd you expect? There are 7 of us coding. It's a marathon weekend, for a top secret app that has already made us enough to retire in our 20s, even before delivering one line of code.

Why would anyone pay us so much for so little?

Well, the sketchup alone, which they received, is actually worth ten times as much as they paid.  

So now we're just racing to delivery the software on time, to earn as much bonus we can on top of the agreed bid price.

If you're wondering who would pay a ton for the draft ideas of a bunch of young programmers? 

You can thank The Crown. 

While we're not at liberty to say which royalty we're talking about, we are able to say that the contract we were awarded is for software to improve efficiencies and reduce financial government waste.

Due date: We're set to deliver this program in the next 72 hours, after weeks of research, months of planning, and almost half a year of creating the relevant equations, formulas, wireframes and work flows of the program.

The first major release is all about the System Control.
